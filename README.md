# Simple Java Programs
A bunch of Java Projects that I made using IDE Eclipse (Java). The reason that they are here is because my IDE stopped working one day and I now have them here. Nothing special about these programs.

























These are simple short programs that I made while using the IDE Eclipse. Note that this is not the only IDE that you could be using you can always use Replit if you do not want to download anything. But if you do want to run them in something a little bit tougher I used IDE Eclipse (JAVA) and/or Visual Studio Code.
