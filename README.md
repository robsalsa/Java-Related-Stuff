# Java-Related-Stuff
A bunch of Java Projects that I made through my time in college

























These are simple short programs that I made while using the IDE Eclipse. Note that this is not the only IDE that you could be using you can always use Replit if you do not want to download anything. But if you do want to run them in something a little bit tougher I used IDE Eclipse (JAVA) and/or Visual Studio Code.
